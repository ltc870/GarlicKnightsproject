            <p>
                As a reader, I need to be able to quickly find book recommendations
                so that I don't waste what little free time I have.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I need a way to input my interests so that I can find
                recommendations based on what I like.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to see variety so that I have a wide range of
                books to choose from.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to be able to mark off books that I may have already read
                so that I can find new books.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to be able to save my interests/genres so that I don't
                have to put in my information everytime I use the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to be able to write my own review about a book if I choose to
                so that others might find my review helpful when picking the same book.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to see the publication date of a book, especially if it’s some 
                form of textbook, so that I know it’s the latest edition of new information.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to create a list of the books that I would like to add from 
                the book recommendations that are presented to me so that I can keep track of
                the books I would like to read next.
