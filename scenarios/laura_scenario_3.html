        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Laura is having lunch with her best friend Ryan. Though they have been 
            friends for 10 years, their reading habits are the exact opposite of each other. 
            Ryan asks Laura what book she is reading because it is one of the topics they 
            always discuss when they see each other.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Ryan does not read much. She would much rather keep up with the latest dog 
            memes on social media or watch the new drama series on Netflix. 
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Ryan explains to Laura that lately she is feeling burned out from screen 
            time and wants to disconnect from it all for a while. She says she has tried 
            various artistic classes such as painting and pottery, which she very much 
            enjoys but she explains that she cannot attend these classes as much as 
            she would like. To Laura’s shock, Ryan mentions that she might want to try 
            reading more often. Ryan has been known to read every now and then, but it is 
            a rare occurrence.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Laura is excited to hear the news. She loves the thought of her best friend 
            becoming a book worm, as much as she is. Laura understands that Ryan’s entertainment 
            interests do not exactly align with hers though. She shares that she recently 
            discovered Overbook and recommends that it would be a great tool for Ryan to use. 
            It makes reading suggestions based on a person’s interests and it is made for any 
            type of reader.
