          Morrie Helps Her Daughter with a Book Report
        </h2>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
          Morrie's daughter needs help writing a book report for her English
          class. She doesn't have a particular book in mind just yet, but she
          has the whole semester to read the book and write her report. Morrie
          wants to help her daughter out so that she can get the best grade
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morrie's daughter presents to her the list of requirements she must
          complete to have a completed assignment. Morrie's daughter must read a
          book of any genre, and the book must be between 200 to 350 pages. In
          her report, Morrie's daughter must be able to identify a theme covered
          in the book, and write about it. She must also be able to identify a
          favorite character, and write about why she likes them. All of this
          must be tied into a summary of the book.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
          Wanting to help her daughter, Morrie utilizes the Overbook app to find
          a book that her daughter would enjoy reading and will meet the
          requirements for the report. She uses the search function to find a
          book that is between 200 to 350 pages, and is a non-fiction book. She
          also uses the filter function to find a book that is rated 4 stars or
          higher. She finds a book that she thinks her daughter would enjoy, and
          she sends her the link to the book.
