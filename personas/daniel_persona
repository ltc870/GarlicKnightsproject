      Daniel, age 37, is a US Navy sailor from El Paso, TX, where he grew up 
      until he left at 20 to join the Navy. He does shipboard maintenance on 
      radar systems that are aboard his ship. He has attended some college, is 
      unmarried, and has no children.
              <br>
      Daniel is comfortable with most mobile and web applications and does not 
      have trouble with technology. He enjoys reading rarely and when he does itâ€™s 
      usually magazines or books relating to cars or technology. He does utilize 
      the Kindle app to read but does not use any other book-related applications. 
     He is interested in finding recommendations for new magazines and gifts for 
      friends and family who enjoy reading.
