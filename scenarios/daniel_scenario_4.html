          Daniel is a sailor who is comfortable with technology and uses the 
          OverBook app to find new magazines and books that he would like to 
          read. Because he is comfortable with technology, he often would like 
          additional features from different applications. Since OverBook is so 
          new, the developers are interested in hearing what new users have to 
          say, but there is no way other than having the user navigate to the 
          webpage and fill out a survey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel does this and requests a way to send feedback to OverBook 
          easily. The developers decided to add small buttons on multiple 
          screens that can redirect the user to a small feedback message that 
          can be sent directly to the developer. They also include a contact 
          option in the navbar of their website.
