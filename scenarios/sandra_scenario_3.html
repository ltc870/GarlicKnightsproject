            differnt book to read for the following month. As the host, it is 
            her job to find the right book for the whole group. She wants to 
            find a recommendation that fits with the current themes.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Sandra has heard from one of her friends in her club about a 
            recommendation app called Overbook. She checked it out, and found 
            the next few month's books in no time.
