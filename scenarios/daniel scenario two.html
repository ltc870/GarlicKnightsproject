          Daniel is a Navy sailor who enjoys reading nonfiction rarely. 
          Daniel’s mother, Barbara, is an avid mystery reader and reads every 
          day. Barbara’s birthday is coming up, and Daniel is interested in 
          giving his mother a new book. 

          Since Daniel is not familiar with what his mother reads, he notes down 
          a few books that his mother has said are her favorite. With the titles, 
          Daniel goes to the OverBook app and searches these books for 
          recommendations. Currently, OverBook does not have a search function 
          and cannot be used to look up any books.

          Daniel puts in a feedback ticket so that he can search on OverBook. 
          The ticket is accepted and a new search feature is created. 
          Now, users can search books so they know the book's genre and other 
          pertinent information.
