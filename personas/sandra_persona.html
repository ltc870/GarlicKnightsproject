          Sandra is a book loving 70 year old. She is currently retired, 
          but she used to work at her local university. She has a bachelor's 
          degree and has a child in their 50s.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-text">
          Sandra loves to read, so much so that its hard to find her without a 
          book. She enjoys quite a few genres, but her favorites are science 
          fiction, Egyptian Mythology, and African American studies. She reads 
          so much it's almost like shes always on the hunt for her next book!
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-text">
          Sandra uses audiobooks to read, which she gets either from her local 
          library or from Amazon. She doesn't use technology very much, but 
          knows how to work her cell phone. She would use a book recommendation 
          app to create a list of books that she wants to read, mostly from her 
          interest genres.
