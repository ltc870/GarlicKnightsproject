          Morrie, age 25, is a government employee who works remotely for the
          Department of Housing and Urban Development. She has a bachelors in
          Marketing, and a Masters in Business Administration. She's married and
          they have a child that's under 2 years old.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-text">
          Morrie is a voracious reader and enjoys reading a variety of books
          including non-fiction, psychology, self-help, research, and job
          specific books. She reads intermittently, sometimes reading everyday
          to finish a book and then going weeks without reading.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-text">
          Morrie utilizes her Kindle application on her phone to read sometimes.
          She's pretty experienced in using various technologies, such as gps,
          social media, healthcare, and banking apps. She would use a book
          recommendation app to find books that she would enjoy reading, and to
          also find books that she would recommend to her friends and family. At
          the moment, she doesn't have a specific book that she's looking for.
