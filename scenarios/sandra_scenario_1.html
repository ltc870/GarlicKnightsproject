        <h2 class="main-section-one-text">Sandra is struggling to find a new audiobook</h2>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Sandra has always looked for a new book once she has finished with her 
            current read. She typically heads over to the local library to return 
            her finished book and check out a new one. She has been struggling to 
            find books at the library lately, however, since she can only read 
            audiobooks, and there aren't many left that are of the genres she 
            enjoys.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Sandra also uses Amazon to source her audiobooks, but Amazon doesn't 
            seem to give her good recommendations for new books. Since she's not 
            exactly tech-savvy, she asks her child about how they would go about 
            finding a new book to read.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Her child searches "book recommendation app" to which they find that 
            Overbook is a suitable application for Sandra. It has all the necessary 
            features, like being able to search by genre, and filtering for audiobooks, 
            as well as being user friendly, even for someone with a low experience 
            level in technology.
