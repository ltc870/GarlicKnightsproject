            <p>
                As a reader, I want to have recommendations on demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to be able to find book recommendations that 
                have audiobook components.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I need to be able to find new books right when I'm 
                done with my current reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to be directed to a purchase site once I 
                find a good recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want my lists to be saved so that I don't need 
                to re-enter the information every time I need a new recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to be able to filter by genre so that I only 
                get books i would want to read in my recommended.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to have an easy to use interface that incorporates 
                all of my preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reader, I want to be able to have a profile where i can store 
                my preferences and come back to see what new recommendations are 
                waiting for me.
