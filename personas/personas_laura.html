            <p>
              Laura, age 32, is a physical therapist in Tacoma, Washington. 
              She works with patients of all ages in a small private practice office. 
              She achieved her degree from Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. 
              She was born in Plainfield, Illinois to parents who were both keen readers. 
              Laura is married, with no children, and loves to read as a way to decompress after work.
            </p>
            <p>
            Laura spends most of her days with her beloved patients. Although she values the 
            interaction and developing these relationships, it does take a toll on her by the 
            end of the day. She loves being able to escape into a good book whenever she has free 
            time. She is the only physical therapist in the office, so she is a busy woman. She does 
            not usually have the time to visit her local library or peruse any bookstores. She mostly 
            gets her next book recommendation from friends or family.
