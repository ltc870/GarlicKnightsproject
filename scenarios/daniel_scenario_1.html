          Daniel is a Navy sailor and is often underway with limited access to 
          the internet or space. He enjoys reading magazines but wants the 
          ability to download magazines onto his personal phone or computer so 
          that he can have access to them regardless of space and internet 
          availability. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel needs access to digital magazines that will be available for 
          his laptop/phone and would like a way to search specifically for 
          digital magazines. Although OverBook has access to ebooks and 
          magazines, there is only a way to search for digitally available 
          resources. 
        </p>
        <p>

          Daniel submitted user feedback to the OverBook application that he 
          would like an additional search feature. The developers added the 
          feature and Daniel is now able to eliminate any physical-only 
          magazines from his recommendations.
