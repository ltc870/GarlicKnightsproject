        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Laura has been a practicing physical therapist for 7 years. 
            Though she has great skill and is recommended as one of the best 
            therapists in her city, she likes to keep up with the latest news and 
            updated practices in the field.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Laura does not like to spend too much time researching on 
            the internet for scholarly articles and research. She also finds that 
            these are a bit of a bore to read. She wants to find a reliable book 
            that she can easily pick up and skim through whenever she chooses.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            She asks some of her classmates, who she remains in regular contact with, 
            if there are any books they would recommend. Only one classmate responded 
            and said that they have not picked up a physical therapy book since they 
            were in school.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Laura decides to do a quick search on the internet and types in 
            “book recommendation generator.” This is where she discovers Overbook.
