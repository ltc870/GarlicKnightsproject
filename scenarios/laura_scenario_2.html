        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Laura likes to call her parents and check on them at least once a week 
            if she can. She calls her mother, Phyllis, and is filling her in about 
            her work week.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Laura and Phyllis have similar interests in book choice to include fantasy, 
            fiction, noir, and science fiction. They often like to share and discuss 
            their current book, though Phyllis gets through them much quicker than Laura.
        </p>
        <p class="main-section-one-paragraph">
            Phyllis tells Laura she wants to buy her father a gift for his upcoming 
            birthday. He is mostly interested in historical fiction and historical 
            non-fiction. Phyllis is having difficulty finding a book because he has read 
            so many. Laura suggests that she use Overbook. She explains to her mother that 
            it is simple to use, and she would be able to get a list of recommendations 
            that her father might like. She can compare the list with the books that he 
            has already read and go from there.
