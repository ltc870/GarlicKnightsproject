              The user interface for OverBook is the web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                The browser will allow clients to utilize any of the application features.
                The functionality of these features are written in Javascript via
                Node.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                OverBook's architecture utilizes an open-source API called Open Library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open Library's API is linked via URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since OverBook incorporates an open-source API, there is no need for building
                a database from scratch. All of the information that may be requested is available
                for use. OverBook's developers only needed to make changes to fit the application
                needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This does come with a downside. If Open Library were to crash at any point then
                OverBook's features would not function properly. The user requests would not be
                able to be sourced.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are few, simple features of OverBook. All of which use the API, so there
                is only one API server that needs to be accessed. There is no concern for overlap.
            </p>
            <p>
              OverBook makes use of a client-server communication pattern. For the back-end, the search
              functions are linked with the URL and the results are returned in a JSON format in order
              for the user to retrieve results.
